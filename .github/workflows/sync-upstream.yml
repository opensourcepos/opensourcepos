            ## Upstream Sync Conflicts
            
            This PR was created because there were conflicts when trying to automatically sync with the upstream OSPOS repository.
            
            **Please review and resolve conflicts manually:**
            
            1. Check the conflicted files
            2. Resolve conflicts while preserving your custom changes
            3. Test the merged code
            4. Merge this PR when ready
