.SYNOPSIS
    Manage feature branches for OSPOS development

.DESCRIPTION
    This script helps create, switch, and manage feature branches
    to keep your features isolated from each other and from the upstream.

.PARAMETER Action
    The action to perform: create, switch, list, merge, delete

.PARAMETER BranchName
    The name of the feature branch

.EXAMPLE
    .\manage-branches.ps1 -Action create -BranchName "feature/turnstile-enhancement"
    .\manage-branches.ps1 -Action list
    .\manage-branches.ps1 -Action switch -BranchName "feature/payment-gateway"
