                            SIZE_SPACING_FONT_END has been suppressed since the previous bug has been fixed.
                            Correct label if two barcode were generated with the same font. The font is now cloned immediately before using.
                            The FDrawing has new methods now, use setBarcode and draw instead of add_barcode and draw_all. Only one barcode per FDrawing is possible now.
                            Correct errors of othercode if no text font has been selected.
                            othercode was not working for PHP4 due to the lack of the str_split function. Now the function is emulated.
                            New file : JoinDraw allows you to join 2 graphic and align each of them. (Useful for UCPExt). PHP5 only
                            Currently Working on UPC-A label

                            NEW support of exterior font (Arial, Courier, etc.) with a size that you can specify
                            Use PHP fonts is deprecated and they will be deleted in further versions.
                            Remove the "alt" text on the image (IE displays it as a tooltip)
                            Color class has been enhanced and accept new parameter for constructor
                            Now you don't have to provide a specific size of the image, it will be calculated automatically for barcodes and errors
                            Added the version number at the bottom of the script html.
                            Correcting code 128 to output code correctly when passing from code C to another code
